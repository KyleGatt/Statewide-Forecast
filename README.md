# Statewide Forecast
 #In a Special Publication that is produced every year by ADF&G (e.g., SP22-11), ADF&G publishes our best estimates for commercial salmon harvests for the coming year and also documents what commercial salmon harvests were for the previous year. 
#This script will be used to assemble table 1 and corrisponding figures of that report and will replace forecast analyses performed in the "Table 1_2025-values.xlsx" file.
